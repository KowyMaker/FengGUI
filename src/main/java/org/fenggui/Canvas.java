/**
 * Widget for customized drawing. By giving an implementation of
 * <code>IPaintListener</code> to this class, the programmer can define his own
 * drawing routine for a Widget. Note that this Widget is not state-enabled. The
 * Canvas poses an alternative to subclassing <code>Widget</code> if the
 * programmer just needs a quick way to draw some stuff in a Widget.
