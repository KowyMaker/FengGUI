/**
 * Decorators are graphics routines to beautify widgets, such as borders and
 * backgrounds. Decorators can be enabled and disabled which means that they are
 * drawn or not. They can also share the same label (state label) for a widget
 * such that they get enabled and disabled collectively. This way, widgets can
 * disabled and enable groups of decorators in their behavior routines (e.g. for
 * mouse hover effects, or to draw a button differently when pressed).
